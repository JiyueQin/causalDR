Description: Methods for causal estimation under covariate-dependent censoring in semi-competing risks data, where individuals may experience a non-terminal and a terminal event. The package provides augmented inverse probability weighting estimators that jointly adjust for censoring and treatment assignment to estimate treatment-specific risks of (i) the non-terminal event, (ii) the terminal event without a prior non-terminal event, and (iii) the terminal event following a non-terminal event.
